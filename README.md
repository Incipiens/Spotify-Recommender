# Converting files to video
This is a program that makes use of the Spotipy library in Python to pull my most listened to music in the short-term (according to the Spotify API) and calculate recommendations for new music based on those recommendations. It will launch a web page that the user can see the songs embedded in, and will create a playlist in the user's account with those songs, too.


## Execution

To execute this project you'll need to install the dependencies listed at the top of the script.

Then run:

```bash
  python spotifyrecommend.py
```

## Documentation
This program was written for an article on XDA-Developers by Adam Conway, Lead Technical Editor of the site.
